## Title
# Cow Disease Prediction using CNN ,Tensorflow JS and React Native.

## Description
This is an cow disease classification react native mobile application that allows users to login and register in with an account and take photos of an cow and have it classified by a Tensorflow & CNN based model. This project was developed using React-Native, Firebase, and TensorflowJS. and model is trained on a custom CNN. Also decision tree is used to predict the disease from symptoms

Following diseases can be classifed using this application:
```
1) Foot and mouth disease

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) git clone this repo
- 1.2) cd cow-disease-prediction
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with your package manager of choice - i.e run `yarn` or `npm install`

#### 2) Start your app

- 2.1) Start the react native packager, run `yarn run start` or `npm start` from the root of your project. If this does not work, if on windows run `npx react-native start --reset-cache`.
- 2.2) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `npm run ios` or `yarn run ios` from the root of your project. The first build will take some time. This will automatically start up a simulator also for you on a successful build if one wasn't already started.
- 2.3) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `npm run android` or `yarn run android` or `npx react-native run-android` from the root of your project.
